This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and it involves an issue with the installation or configuration of the necessary dependencies. The exact cause may vary depending on your system's environment, but it frequently relates to problems with Node.js, npm, or the Expo CLI itself.  The error message might not directly point to the root cause, requiring some debugging steps to pinpoint the problem.  For example, you might see a message like 'Error: Command failed: ...',  'Error: Cannot find module ...', or a similar message that indicates a dependency-related problem.
