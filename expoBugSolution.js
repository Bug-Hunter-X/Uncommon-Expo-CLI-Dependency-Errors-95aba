The solution involves verifying the installation of all necessary packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. If problems persist, you might need to check for version conflicts or try reinstalling the Expo CLI globally. Also check your Node.js and npm versions to ensure compatibility.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
npm install expo-cli --global //Reinstall Expo CLI globally
npm install //Install project dependencies
//If using yarn
yarn install
```
In the case of specific missing modules, you can install them individually.  For example, if the error mentions a missing module named 'react-native-gesture-handler', you can install it using `npm install react-native-gesture-handler`.
